## 🔑 Prerequisites
- Neovim v0.5 or higher (seriously, don’t be a noob)
- A terminal that won’t give you nightmares (zsh, bash, or whatever floats your boat)
- Git (because, duh, how else will you clone this beauty?)

## 🛠️ Installation
1. **Clone this bad boy** into your local setup:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isaka-james/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```

2. **Install the plugins** (Make sure you have a plugin manager set up):
   - If you’re using `vim-plug`, just run:
     ```vim
     :PlugInstall
     ```
   - If you’re rocking `packer.nvim`, run:
     ```vim
     :PackerSync
     ```

3. **Fire up Neovim** and bask in the glory of your new setup:
   ```bash
   nvim
   ```

## 🛡️ Configuration Overview
Dive into the `init.vim` and check out all the tweaks and features I've crammed in here. I’ve added some spicy keybindings and nifty options that’ll make your coding life a dream (or a nightmare, depending on your mood).

## 🌟 Features
- **Syntax Highlighting**: No more dull code! Watch your syntax pop like a firework! 🎆
- **Auto-completion**: Type less, code more. Who doesn’t want that? 🤖
- **File Explorer**: Navigate through your projects like a pro. No more searching like a lost puppy! 🐶
- **Theming**: Because your IDE should match your inner vibe. Choose from my killer themes or make your own! 🌈
- **Linting & Formatting**: Keep your code clean, or be prepared for the wrath of the linter gods. ⚡️

## 🤫 Tips & Tricks
- **Use the command line**: Embrace the terminal; it’s your best friend. Get cozy with `:Terminal` in Neovim for that extra edge. 💪
- **Keybindings**: Customize them until they’re second nature. Life’s too short for complicated workflows. 🌀
- **Explore plugins**: Don’t be shy; expand your setup with some dope plugins. Just don’t go overboard, or you’ll turn Neovim into a monster. 🧟‍♂️
